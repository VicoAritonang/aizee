## Common Issues & Solutions

### Setup Issues

**Q: I'm getting "Module not found" errors**
A: Make sure you've installed all dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

**Q: Environment variables not working**
A: Check that your `.env.local` file exists and contains the correct Supabase credentials:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

**Q: Build fails with TypeScript errors**
A: Run type checking to see specific errors:
```bash
npm run type-check
```

### Authentication Issues

**Q: Google OAuth not working**
A: Make sure you've configured Google OAuth in your Supabase project:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Providers
2. Enable Google provider
3. Add your Google OAuth credentials

**Q: Users can't register/login**
A: Check your Supabase Auth settings:
1. Verify email confirmation is configured correctly
2. Check RLS policies are set up properly
3. Ensure your site URL is added to allowed redirect URLs

### Database Issues

**Q: Database tables not created**
A: Run the SQL setup script in Supabase:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-setup.sql`
3. Execute the script

**Q: Visit counter not working**
A: Make sure the `site_stats` table exists and has the correct structure:
```sql
SELECT * FROM site_stats WHERE id = 1;
```

### Deployment Issues

**Q: Vercel deployment fails**
A: Check your build logs and ensure:
1. All environment variables are set in Vercel
2. Node.js version is 18+ (check `.nvmrc`)
3. Build command is correct: `npm run build`

**Q: Docker container won't start**
A: Verify your Docker setup:
```bash
docker build -t aizee .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=... aizee
```

## Performance Tips

### Development

- Enable Turbo mode for faster builds
- Use VS Code with recommended extensions

### Production

- Monitor performance with Vercel Analytics

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit `.env.local` files
